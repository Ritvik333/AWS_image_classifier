# LambdaVision

**LambdaVision** is a cloud-based platform developed for the **Cloud Computing Term Assignment** at Dalhousie University. The system allows users to upload images, which are then processed using MobileNetSSD, which combines MobileNet, a streamlined convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, with Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), a method for detecting objects in images in a single pass to identify objects within the images. The primary goal of the system is to provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for image recognition tasks. The system is designed for general users who need to classify images (e.g., identifying animals, multiple objects in a single image) and is expected to handle moderate traffic with low latency responses.
